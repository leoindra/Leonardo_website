<h2>Working Papers:</h2>
<ul><li><h5> Entrepreneurship Over The Life-Cycle: The Role of Human versus Financial Capital Accumulation <i>(Draft available upon request)<i> </h5> (<i>with Jacek Piosik</i>)
<p><small>In this paper we use administrative data on the population of Danish entrepreneurs to provide new facts on the taxonomy of entrepreneurship over the life-cycle. We document that entrepreneurs are on average 38 when opening their first firm and that ex-post successful entrepreneurs are even older at business start. We ask whether these life-cycle patterns are mainly explained by the need of accumulating financial assets or entrepreneurial human capital. We provide reduced form evidence that the entrepreneur's human capital at entry is an important predictor for firm survival and success, much more than his wealth at business foundation.  Motivated by these empirical facts we develop an occupational choice model in which agents can accumulate entrepreneurial human capital before becoming entrepreneurs. We bring the model to the data and use it to further disentangle the role of human versus financial capital for business formation as well as for the age composition of new entrepreneurs. Finally, we implement the 2014 Danish policy reform in our framework, which lowered the initial capital requirements for incorporated firms. We show that our model comes much closer in matching the response in new business creation observed in the data, compared to traditional models without human capital.</small></p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p><h5>Covid and Productivity in Europe: A Responsiveness Perspective <i>(Draft available upon request)</h5>   <i>(with <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/coopereconomics/ target="_blank">Russell Cooper</a> and Wolfram Horn </i>)
<p><small> This paper studies the effects of Covid-19 on manufacturing output, employment and productivity across a set of European countries. Using a dynamic labor demand framework, key parameters of adjustment costs and market power are estimated to match the country-specific responsiveness of firms to variations in demand and productivity. We find that most heterogeneity in firm responsiveness reflects differences in labor adjustment costs which we trace back to country specific institutional environments. The estimated model is used to simulate the effects of the Covid-19 shock, without and with policy measures. Through these counterfactual exercises, the main impact of the policy interventions, treated here as wage subsidies and no firing restrictions, was to reduce the exit of firms. Firing restrictions were much less powerful and are seen to induce firm exit. The ability of the government to correctly identify firms that need assistance is crucial in order not to generate a generation of “zombie firms” with negative effects on aggregate productivity.</small></p></li></ul>

<h2>Work in Progress:</h2>
<ul><li><h5> Job Search under the Threat of Unemployment Benefit Sanctions</h5>
<p><small>How does the threat of punishment in the unemployment insurance system affect job search behaviours and subsequent labour market outcomes? This project uses a difference-in-differences design, leveraging the differential response of districts to largescale welfare reform in the United Kingdom during the early 2010s to examine the impact of unemployment benefit sanctioning threat on jobseeker exit from unemployment and future outcomes. Constructing working life histories from panel survey data, result show that average district sanctioning rate increases the rate at which jobseekers exit unemployment signficantly.</small></p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p><h5>Fiscal Policy in Firm-level Production Networks</h5>
(<i>with Wolfram Horn</i>)</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p><h6> Making the Cut: Close Elections and Local Economic Policy</h6>
(<i>with Nikolaj Broberg and Tuuli Tähtinen</i>)</p></li></ul>
