<p><small> This paper studies the effects of Covid-19 on manufacturing output, employment and productivity across a set of European countries. Using a quantitative firm dynamics model with endogenous entry and exit, key parameters of adjustment costs and market power are estimated to match country-specific responsiveness of firms to exogenous shocks. We find that most heterogeneity in firm responsiveness reflects differences in labor adjustment costs. The estimated model is used to simulate the effects of the Covid-19 shock, with and without policy measures. Through these counterfactual exercises, the main impact of the policy interventions, treated here as work-sharing schemes targeted to low profitability firms and “no-firing” obligations, was to mitigate the drop in aggregate employment by keeping firms in business. We do not find evidence of adverse productivity effects from these interventions. Depending on the country, we calculate that the aggregate drop in employment would have been between 1.4 to 2.6 percentage points higher without policy support. From these counterfactuals, we establish the importance of targeted subsidies and the sensitivity of employment responses to firm beliefs. </small></p></li></ul>

<ul><li><h5> Entrepreneurship Over The Life-Cycle: The Role of Human versus Financial Capital Accumulation </h5> (<i>with Jacek Piosik </i>)

<h5> Presented at: <small> Theories and Methods in Macroeconomics 2022 (T2M2022), Spring Meeting of Young Economists (SMYE2022), Barcelona Summer Forum 2022 , EUI Alumni Conference 2022, Vigo Workshop on Dynamic Macroeconomics 2022, EEA-ESEM Congress 2022  </small></h5>

<p><small> In this paper we use administrative data on the population of Danish entrepreneurs to provide new facts on the taxonomy of entrepreneurship over the life-cycle. We document that entrepreneurs are on average 38 when opening their first firm and that ex-post successful entrepreneurs are even older at business start. We ask whether these life-cycle patterns are mainly explained by the need of accumulating financial assets or entrepreneurial human capital. We provide reduced form evidence that the entrepreneur's human capital at entry is an important predictor for firm survival and success, much more than his wealth at business foundation.  Motivated by these empirical facts we develop an occupational choice model in which agents can accumulate entrepreneurial human capital before becoming entrepreneurs. We bring the model to the data and use it to further disentangle the role of human versus financial capital for business formation as well as for the age composition of new entrepreneurs. Finally, we implement the 2014 Danish policy reform in our framework, which lowered the initial capital requirements for incorporated firms. We show that our model comes much closer in matching the response in new business creation observed in the data, compared to traditional models without human capital.</small></p></li></ul>
